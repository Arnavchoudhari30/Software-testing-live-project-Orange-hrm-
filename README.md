The primary objective of this repository is to provide a comprehensive set of test cases for the login functionality of the OrangeHRM live project. These test cases are designed to ensure:

Functional Accuracy: The login feature operates as intended, validating credentials and granting access securely.
User Experience: Error messages and responses for invalid inputs or actions are clear and user-friendly.
Security: The system safeguards against unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, and other common vulnerabilities.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: The login page performs consistently across various browsers and devices.
Automation Readiness: The test cases are structured to be easily automated for regression testing.
